# Time-Series-Analysis_Tutorial-with-Examples
Times series analysis by using statsmodels, scipy and tensorflow

This Repository aims to teach most common and useful methods and algorithms used in Time Series Analysis.


To achieve our **Goals**, we employed the knowledge that we gained from different online resources, therefore, we would like to thank them all and mention them as follows:
1. LazyProgrammer - Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and Machine Learning (Udemy) [see the course](https://www.udemy.com/share/104I9M3@hh4fQRKXj2j5JhjmQwdnTHJIPmTzd2JGLjX-sm8bRWolmpJLpFW62EDA7C-dXkWx/)
    - **Basics**
        1. Box-Cox power transformation (extra reading [here](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1401/1401.3812.pdf))
        2. Naive Forecast
    - **Exponential Smoothing (ETS)**
        1. Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
        2. Exponential weighted Smoothing (EWS)
    - **Exponential Smoothing and Prediction**
        1. Holt-Winters - Simple Exponential Smoothing (HW-SES)
        2. Holt-Winters - Holt's Linear Trend Model
        3. Holt-Winters - Exponential Smoothing
